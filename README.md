# Qutrit-gate-wavefront-matching

I adapted the Wavefront matching code, generously provided as a supplementary resource to the article

["Near-perfect measuring of full-field transverse-spatial modes of light "
Optics Express 27 (22), 31456 (2019) , Hiekkamaki Markus et al.](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-27-22-31456&id=422327)

, to program a set of spatial light modulators in the laboratory for use as qutrit quantum gates. I express my heartfelt appreciation to the authors for sharing this invaluable library.
