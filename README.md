# Qutrit-gate-wavefront-matching

I adapted Wavefront matching code provided as a supplementary to the article

["Near-perfect measuring of full-field transverse-spatial modes of light "
Optics Express 27 (22), 31456 (2019) , Hiekkamaki Markus et al.](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-27-22-31456&id=422327)

to program a set of spatial light modulators in the laboratory to function as qutrit quantum gates. 

I express my sincere gratitude to the authors for providing this useful library :
